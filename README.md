Before going straight to the project, it is important to outline what our web server will do, so that it is easier to follow the steps later on.

The web server youâ€™ll build controls two LEDs connected to the ESP32 GPIO 26 and GPIO 27;
You can access the ESP32 web server by typing the ESP32 IP address on a browser in the local network;
By clicking the buttons on your web server you can instantly change the state of each LED.
This is just a simple example to illustrate how to build a web server that controls outputs, the idea is to replace those LEDs with a relay, or any other electronic components you want.
